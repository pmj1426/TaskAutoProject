1. Spawn Applications
2. Collect metrics
3. Write data to file
4. Cleanup processes and applications

Philip: collect process level metrics
	process level:
	% CPU usage and % memory per process
	use ps command

Jonah: collect system level metrics
	system level: 
	network bandwidth, hard disk access rates, hard disk utilization
	use ifstat for bandwidth
	iostat for hard disk write
	hard disk utilization uses the df tool

Ben: spawn and cleanup the processes
	each application takes an IP address for an argument

Overview of Functiion:
	samples network data every second
	collects the network data every 5 seconds
	collects all process and system data every 5 seconds
